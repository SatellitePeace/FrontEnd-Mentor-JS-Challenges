## My process

I used bootstrap for all the sections with grid structures to avoid writing media queries for responsiveness. But majority of the styles were done using vanilla CSS.

Although it was not required by the challenge, i added a hamburger menu for screen size <= 768px

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
